Hi Welcome back to Laravel podcast. I'm your host Matt Stauffer, CEO of Tighten. And in this season, I'll be joined every episode by a member of Laravel team. Today, I am talking to my old dear friend Jess Archer the engineering team lead APAC team at Laravel. I should have written that down. I think I got that right. So Jess, Whether or not I got that right, can you say hi and talk a little bit about what you do with Laravel day to day?
