Hi Welcome back to Laravel podcast. I'm your host Matt Stauffer, CEO of Tighten. And in this season, I'll be joined every episode by a member of Laravel team. Today, I am talking to my old dear friend Jess Archer the engineering team lead APAC team at Laravel. I should have written that down. I think I got that right. So Jess, Whether or not I got that right, can you say hi and talk a little bit about what you do with Laravel day to day?

That was perfect by the way.
Yes!
So my name is Jess Archer and I'm from Brisbane, Australia, Engineering Team Lead on the Nightwatch slash APAC team, which is the Australia Pacific. And yeah, what do I do at the moment building Nightwatch? I've kind of forgotten the rest of the questions. So if you want to go ahead and ...
That's totally fine. That's it. You build Nightwatch. I'll walk you through the rest of it. It's so funny because when I say your name, it's hard for not to say it in your accent because I just like it's just Jess Archer, like that's the way it should be. But I, you know, it's not respectful to, to mock somebody's accent. So, but in my head it is not Jess Archer. I don't hear it in English. I hear it or an American accent. I hear it in Australian accent. So there you go.

I love that.

Okay, the first thing I want to check in with which I do with everybody else is what is the story of you joining Laravel? You know where were you beforehand? What were you doing kind of and what interesting things happened between you know?
